# React API UI Project

You're going to build out a web-application in React and integrate it with an API. 

# Requirements and MVP

1. Be built with React.
2. Consume data from an external source (3rd party API)
3. Use flexbox (display: flex) and/or CSS Grid (display: grid)
4. Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile)
5. Have a well developed README, documenting what your app is/how it works.
    - Things that you can add (all optional):
      - Title, Description, Technologies used, Screenshot of App, Screenshot of wireframe, API info, 
7. Host on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

# Instructions

1. **Research** and Choose Your API!
2. Wireframe Your App
3. Use `create-react-app` or `vite` to create a directory in your terminal
4. Create your project repository on your **personal GitHub**
6. Submit your work as an `issue` on this repository. Be sure to put both the **deployed app link** and your **Github repo link**

# Suggested APIs

> 📝 Reminder: Not all APIs on this list are created equal, and some may not work anymore, but there are many that are good. Take some time to parse through the topics that interest you and explore the documentation on each API. (Bad documentation is a 🚩). **Also, make note of any API call limits!**
> <br> <br> This list is also not exhaustive. Feel free to search for other topics as well.

## Possible UI Patterns for Inspiration

### List of UI Patterns
#### Modal

When a user clicks on a link, a box should appear in the center of the screen
with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should have some
way for the user to close the box and see the full list of items.

![modal](https://media.git.generalassemb.ly/user/8618/files/3422a180-fa60-11e9-82a9-3e11fbe9da37)

#### Hamburger Menu

There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on
it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the screen with a list of
menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the contents in the center of
the page should change to show the details for that item. The user should be
able to see which item is currently selected. The user should be able to close
the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.

#### Accordion

The user should see a list of items. When they click on one, the space below the
item expands to reveal the content related to that item. When the user clicks on
the item again, the revealed content becomes hidden.

#### Tabs

The user sees a row of tabs above a content area. When the user clicks on one of
the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which tab the user
clicked.

#### Slider

The user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and 'Previous'
buttons. When they click on the 'Next' button, the slider should shift to show
the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the 'Previous' button, the
slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next
or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent
the user from clicking those buttons.

# Deliverable 

This is a requirement! It must be deployed and you need to submit an issue` on this repo with the following info:
   - Link to your personal Github Repo that contains the code for the app
   - Link to the deployed app
